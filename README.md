## Description

The motivation to start this project was to provide as much information for any potential boot camp student, who already is: stressed and overwhelmed with the journey their on. The goal is to minimize as much chaos and offer access to a central web page that will provide a high level overview on Web Development in an organized and efficient way. This is in an effort to combat the notion that becoming a developer is too difficult of a challenge and to allow for equal access and a fair marketplace of resources for anyone interested in becoming a Web Developer.
